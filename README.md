# TeamsPushToTalk

Push-to-Talk for Microsoft Teams

After two weeks of home office the fact that MS Teams is missing a Push-to-Talk function is seriously bugging me. 

According to [uservoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/18837436-allow-users-to-enable-push-to-talk-in-group-meetin), Microsoft has put it in their backlog.

Meanwhile, just use this workaround.

Usage:
* Start TeamsPushToTalk.exe
* Start MS Teams
* From any window, press and hold the **middle mouse button* to speak.
